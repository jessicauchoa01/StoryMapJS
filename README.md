Example of how to create a Story Map JS

## 🗺 Site of the tool:

Access this link and sign in: https://storymap.knightlab.com/

## 🚀 Start
This page will open and you must add the name of your application:
![start](https://github.com/jessicauchoa01/StoryMapJS/assets/75124373/b4b0fa7e-cbc6-4ba9-861b-86964d57f1ff)

## 🎨 Styling first page
After that, style your first page with the most important information about your story. You can add a title, a description, a photo or video, and customize the page. Below is a simple example:

## 🎞 YouTube video
In the example below, we added our first point using geographic coordinates. But don't be scared, we'll add a pin directly to the map later. This time our media will be a YouTube video:

## 📷 Adding photo
To add a photo the path is the same, you need to indicate the folder where your file is (or if you prefer, add a URL to an image from the internet).
